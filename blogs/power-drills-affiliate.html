            <h2>The Evolution of Power Drills in Woodworking</h2>
            <p>Power drills emerged in the early 20th century as corded tools revolutionizing construction and woodworking. The introduction of cordless technology in the 1990s made them more portable, and today's models incorporate lithium-ion batteries, brushless motors, and smart features for enhanced performance.</p>

            <h2>Why Power Drills Are Essential for Woodworkers</h2>

            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Versatility makes them indispensable for home projects, from furniture making to home repairs.</p>

            <h2>Key Factors in Selecting a Power Drill</h2>
            <p>When choosing a drill, evaluate:</p>
            <ul>
